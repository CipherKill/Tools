Read below to get to know the program better.
# What is SolPlay?
It is a tool that is made specifically for GTA online players to toggle WiFi between ON and OFF along with the ability to make solo public sessions by suspending and resuming process automatically.  
Also this is a universal program, so it works with any application (but intended for GTA).  
# How does it work?
When the program is being run, temporary hotkeys will be created that enable the user to execute functions when the program is not the active window; you can use the hotkeys while being in-game.  
# IMPORTANT : If downloading error takes place, then disable antivirus and download.
# REASON : The antivirus acts crazy as the program can interact with process i.e Suspending/Resuming. You are free to go through the source code if you wish.
I have tried my best to put comments in source code so anyone can read.
# How to Run
Download the ZIP/RAR file, Extract, then directly run the executable.  
Note: Incase the program does not work correctly, then run as Administrator.
# How to use
[F5] : Turn off wifi  
[F6] : Turn on wifi (reconnect)  
[F7] : SUS/RES (SUSPEND/RESUME) -> This function will put you in a solo public lobby in 7 seconds. [NOTE: Be patient when this is being executed.]  
[F8] : Exit the program
