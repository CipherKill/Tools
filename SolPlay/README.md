#What is SolPlay?
It is a tool that is made specifically for GTA online players to toggle WiFi between ON and OFF along with the ability to make solo public sessions by suspending and resuming  
process automatically.  
Also this is a universal program, so it works with any application (but intended for GTA).
#How does it work?
When the program is being run, temporary hotkeys will be created that enable the user to execute functions when the program is not the active window; you can use the hotkeys  
while being in-game.  
#How to Run
Download the ZIP file, Extract, then directly run the executable.  
Note: Incase the program does not work correctly, then run as Administrator.
#How to use
[F5] : Turn off wifi  
[F6] : Turn on wifi (reconnect)  
[F7] : SUS/RES (SUSPEND/RESUME) -> This function will put you in a solo public lobby in 7 seconds. [NOTE: Be patient when this is being executed.]  
[F8] : Exit the program
